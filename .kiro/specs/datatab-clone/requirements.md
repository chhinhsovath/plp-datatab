# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a DataTab clone - a comprehensive web-based statistical analysis platform that enables users to perform data analysis, create visualizations, and generate statistical reports without requiring advanced programming knowledge. The platform should provide an intuitive interface for data import, manipulation, statistical testing, and result visualization, making statistical analysis accessible to researchers, students, and professionals across various domains.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to import data from various file formats, so that I can analyze my existing datasets without manual data entry.

3. WHEN a user uploads a JSON file THEN the system SHALL flatten nested structures and present data in tabular format
4. WHEN a user provides a URL to a dataset THEN the system SHALL fetch and import the remote data
5. IF the uploaded file exceeds 100MB THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest data reduction techniques
6. WHEN data import is successful THEN the system SHALL display basic dataset information (rows, columns, data types)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to clean and preprocess my data, so that I can ensure data quality before performing statistical analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a column THEN the system SHALL display data type options (numeric, categorical, date, text)
2. WHEN a user identifies missing values THEN the system SHALL provide options to handle them (remove, fill with mean/median/mode, interpolate)
3. WHEN a user detects outliers THEN the system SHALL highlight them and provide removal or transformation options
4. WHEN a user wants to filter data THEN the system SHALL provide conditional filtering options with logical operators
5. WHEN a user needs to create new variables THEN the system SHALL provide a formula builder with common mathematical operations
6. WHEN data preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL save the cleaned dataset and maintain version history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to perform basic statistical analyses, so that I can understand my data distribution and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects descriptive statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate and display mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, min, max, and quartiles
2. WHEN a user requests frequency analysis THEN the system SHALL generate frequency tables and histograms for categorical and continuous variables
3. WHEN a user wants correlation analysis THEN the system SHALL compute correlation matrices and display correlation heatmaps
4. WHEN a user performs normality testing THEN the system SHALL execute Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Anderson-Darling tests
5. WHEN a user needs cross-tabulation THEN the system SHALL create contingency tables with chi-square test results
6. IF insufficient data is provided for a test THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with minimum sample size requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to conduct advanced statistical tests, so that I can validate my hypotheses and draw meaningful conclusions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs t-tests THEN the system SHALL execute one-sample, independent samples, and paired t-tests with assumption checking
2. WHEN a user conducts ANOVA THEN the system SHALL perform one-way and two-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests when significant
3. WHEN a user runs regression analysis THEN the system SHALL provide linear, multiple, logistic, and polynomial regression with diagnostic plots
4. WHEN a user performs non-parametric tests THEN the system SHALL execute Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Kruskal-Wallis tests
5. WHEN a user conducts chi-square tests THEN the system SHALL perform goodness-of-fit and independence tests with effect size calculations
6. WHEN statistical assumptions are violated THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative non-parametric tests or data transformations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to create interactive visualizations, so that I can effectively communicate my findings and explore data patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a chart THEN the system SHALL provide options for bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, box plots, and histograms
2. WHEN a user customizes visualizations THEN the system SHALL allow modification of colors, labels, titles, axes, and legends
3. WHEN a user creates multiple plots THEN the system SHALL provide dashboard functionality to arrange and compare visualizations
4. WHEN a user hovers over data points THEN the system SHALL display interactive tooltips with detailed information
5. WHEN a user exports visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide high-resolution PNG, SVG, and PDF format options
6. WHEN a user shares visualizations THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links with embedded interactive charts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a professional, I want to generate comprehensive statistical reports, so that I can document my analysis and share results with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an analysis THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a report with methodology, results, and interpretations
2. WHEN a user customizes reports THEN the system SHALL allow addition of custom text, conclusions, and recommendations
3. WHEN a user exports reports THEN the system SHALL provide PDF, Word, and HTML format options
4. WHEN a user includes statistical output THEN the system SHALL format tables and results according to APA style guidelines
5. WHEN a user adds visualizations to reports THEN the system SHALL maintain high-quality formatting and proper captions
6. WHEN a user saves reports THEN the system SHALL maintain version control and allow collaborative editing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate on data analysis projects, so that I can work efficiently with colleagues and share insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project THEN the system SHALL provide sharing options with different permission levels (view, edit, admin)
2. WHEN multiple users work on a project THEN the system SHALL track changes and maintain an audit trail
3. WHEN a user comments on analysis THEN the system SHALL provide threaded discussions linked to specific results or visualizations
4. WHEN a user shares datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain data privacy controls and access restrictions
5. WHEN team members collaborate THEN the system SHALL provide real-time notifications of changes and updates
6. WHEN a project is completed THEN the system SHALL allow archiving with full reproducibility of all analyses

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to be accessible and user-friendly, so that I can focus on analysis rather than learning complex software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for data manipulation
2. WHEN a user performs analysis THEN the system SHALL provide guided workflows with step-by-step instructions
3. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages with suggested solutions
